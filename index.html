      <h2>What Is Computer Engineering?</h2>
      <p>Computer Engineering can be different subjects such as hardware, software, and electrical engineering. Hardware engineering is the development of technology such as a computer which can be a desktop or server. Hardware can even be the TV you watch at night or a phone. Software engineering is the devlopment of apps or programs such as Zoom or Youtube. Electrical is the circuitry between pieces of hardware.</p>
